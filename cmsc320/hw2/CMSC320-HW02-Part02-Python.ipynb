The game rules are as follows. You roll the die once. The number that comes up is the \"base number\" ($N$). This establishes a score multiplier for the game. You then continue to roll the die. For each subsequent roll, if you roll a number less than or equal to $N$, you add that roll's value multiplied by $N$ to your score. However, if you roll a number greater than $N$, the game ends, and you lose a penalty of $N^2$ from your score. The game stops either after 10 rolls or when you roll a number greater than $N$, whichever comes first.\n","\n","\n","> **Task to do:** Code a simulation of this game in Python and return the **mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation and variance** in order.
